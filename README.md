# &#181;IAM

&#181;IAM (micro-IAM) is a micro-gateway for **Identity and Access Management** designed for micro-services architectures.

It acts as a reverse proxy in front of resources to be protected providing Authentication and Authorization services.

 &#181;IAM enables developers to configure security policies in standardized micro-gateway instances that are external to APIs and micro-services implementation avoiding coding security functions and a centralized gateway where scalability is a key concern.

> Think about &#181;IAM as the brick that you put in front of your APIs and micro-services to protect them. 

## Main features

- Placement within the container AND on the network layer
- Basic and Token Authentication
- Roles based Authorization
- Extensible and Configurable
- Solid multi-threaded, no blocking architecture
- High performance
- Small memory footprint
- Straightforward configuration

The following diagram shows &#181;IAM used as a sidecar proxy within each container pod. Each micro-service is protected by an instance of &#181;IAM with its own security policy.
