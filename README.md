**restheart-security** is the new security service for [RESTHeart v4](https://restheart.org), the Web API for MongoDB. It acts as a reverse proxy for HTTP resources, providing __Authentication__ and __Authorization__ services. 

**restheart-security** enables developers to configure security policies in standardized micro-gateway instances that are external to API and microservices implementations, avoiding coding security functions and a centralized gateway where scalability is a key concern.

**restheart-security** can also be used as a micro-gateway for **Identity and Access Management**  in any HTTP-based microservices architecture. 

> Think about restheart-security as the "brick" that you put in front of your API and microservices to protect them. 

# Plugins

**restheart-security** is built around a __pluggable architecture__. It comes with a strong security implementation but you can easily extend it by implementing plugins. 

> Building a plugin is as easy as implementing a simple interface and edit a configuration file. Plugins also allow to quickly implement and deploy secure Web Services.

## Maven artifacts

You can find pre-built Maven artifacts on Jitpack.io. That allows to add RESTHeart Security as a dependency on you own POM and build new plugins.
