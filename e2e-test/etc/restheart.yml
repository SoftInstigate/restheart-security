## RESTHeart Configuration File.
---
#### Instance

# The name of this instance. displayed in log, also allows to implement instance specific custom code
# For instance, an email notifier hook can send emails to a test email address in development environments

instance-name: integration-test

# Optional base URL for the instance. When RESTHeart is exposed via a reverse-proxy
# or an API gateway it allows mapping the Location header correctly.

instance-base-url: http://127.0.0.1:18080/

#### Listeners

# Listeners allow to specify the protocol, ip, port and to use.
# The supported protocols are: http, https and ajp. 

https-listener: false
https-host: 0.0.0.0
https-port: 4443

http-listener: false
http-host: 0.0.0.0
http-port: 8080

ajp-listener: true
ajp-host: 0.0.0.0
ajp-port: 8009

#### MongoDB

##  MongoDb Connection

# Set the MongoDb connection using a Mongo Client URI.
#
# The format of the URI is:
#    mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]
#
# Use The URI query parameter 'authSource' to specify the authetication database:
# mongodb://user:secret@127.0.0.1/?authSource=authdb
#
# More information at http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientURI.html

mongo-uri: mongodb://mongodb

## MongoDb resources

# Use mongo-mounts to expose MongoDb resources binding them to API URIs.
#
# The parameter 'what' identifies the MongoDb resource to expose.
# The format is /db[/coll[/docid]]
# Use the wildcard '*' to expose all dbs.
#
# The parameter 'where' defines the URI to bind the resource to. 
# It can be an absolute path (eg. /api) or path template (eg. /{foo}/bar/*).
# The values of the path templates properties are available:
# - in the 'what' property (e.g. what: /{foo}_db/coll)
# - programmatically from RequestContext.getPathTemplateParamenters() method.
#
# It is not possible to mix absolute paths and path templates: 'where' URIs 
# need to be either all absolute paths or all path templates.
#
# Examples:
# The following exposes all MongoDb resources.
# In this case the URI of a document is /db/coll/docid
#
#   - what: "*"
#     where: /
#
# The following binds the URI /database to the db 'db'
# In this case the URI of a document is /database/coll/docid
#
#   - what: /db/coll
#     where: /database
#
# The following binds the URI /api to the collection 'db.coll'
# In this case the URI of a document is /api/docid
#
#   - what: /db/coll
#     where: /api

mongo-mounts:
  - what: "*"
    where: /
  - what: "*"
    where: /remappedall
  - what: /testdb
    where: /remappeddb
  - what: /testdb/refcoll1
    where: /remappedrefcoll1
  - what: /testdb/refcoll2
    where: /remappedrefcoll2
  - what: /testdb/refcoll1/doc1
    where: /remappeddoc1
  - what: /testdb/refcoll2/doc2
    where: /remappeddoc2

#### Default representation format https://restheart.org/docs/representation-format/

## STANDARD  root and dbs as an array of children's ids
##           collection as arrays of document objects and documents as objects
## HAL       Hypertext Application Language
## SHAL      Simplified HAL with children as direct elements of _embedded array

## PLAIN_JSON or HAL are aliases for SHAL
## S is an alias for STANDARD

default-representation-format: HAL

#### Static Web Resources

# Static web resources to bind to the URL specified by the 'where' property.
# The 'what' property is the path of the directory containing the resources.
# The path is either absolute (starts with /) or relative to the restheart.jar file
# If embedded is true, the resources are either included in the restheart.jar or 

static-resources-mounts:
#  - what: /path/to/resources
#    where: /static
#    welcome-file: index.html
#    embedded: false

#### Plugins configuration

# All plugins accept the argument 'confArgs'. Set 'confArgs' defining an object 
# with the same name of the plugin (as defined in its @RegisterPlugin annotation).
# The property 'enabled' allows enabling plugins that are not enabled by default,
# i.e. that are registered with @RegisterPlugin( .., enabledByDefault=false) 
# The property 'uri' optionally sets the uri of Service plugins overwriting its
# default value if specified with the Service.defaultUri() method.

plugins-args:
  logMessageInitializer:
    enabled: false
    message: Hello World!
    log-level: INFO
  addBodyToWriteResponsesInitializer:
    enabled: false
  pingService:
    #uri: "/hello"
    msg: Hello World!

#### Security

# TLS Configuration

# Configure the keystore to enable the https listener.

# RESTHeart comes with an embedded self-signed certificate that makes 
# straightforward enabling https for testing purposes.
# Specify use-embedded-keystore: true (default value) to use it, however take
# into account that it is insercure. DON'T USE IT IN PRODUCTION! 

use-embedded-keystore: true

# To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA 
# certificates chain) into a java keystore and specify use-embedded-keystore: false 
# and the keystore-file,keystore-password and certpassword configuration properties.
# See https://restheart.org/docs/security/tls/

#keystore-file: /path/to/keystore/file
#keystore-password: password
#certpassword: password

## Aggregations variables

# Check if aggregation variables use operators. allowing operators in aggregation variables 
# is risky. requester can inject operators modifying the query

aggregation-check-operators: true

## Allow unescaped characters in URL

# Starting with Undertow 1.4.23 URLs validation became much stricter.
# However, this is breaking existing clients. Now you can decide which behaviour you prefer

allow-unescaped-characters-in-url: true

## ETag policy

# the following configuration defines the default etag check policy
# the policy applies for dbs, collections (also applies to file buckets) and documents
# valid values are REQUIRED, REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE, OPTIONAL

etag-check-policy:
  db: REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE
  coll: REQUIRED_FOR_DELETE
  doc: OPTIONAL

#### Logging

# enable-log-console: true => log messages to the console (default value: true)
# enable-log-file: true => log messages to a file (default value: true)
# log-file-path: to specify the log file path (default value: restheart.log in system temporary directory)
# log-level: to set the log level. Value can be OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE and ALL. (default value is INFO)
# ansi-console: use Ansi console for logging. Default to 'true' if parameter missing, for backward compatibility
# requests-log-level: log the request-response. 0 => no log, 1 => light log, 2 => detailed dump
# requests-log-trace-headers: add the HTTP headers you want to be put on the MDC for logback. Use with %X{header-name} in logback.xml.
#                             Useful for tracing support in the logs. Leave empty to deactivate this feature.
# metrics-gathering-level: metrics gathering for which level? OFF => no gathering, ROOT => gathering at root level,
#                          DATABASE => at db level, COLLECTION => at collection level
# WARNING: use requests-log-level level 2 only for development purposes, it logs user credentials (Authorization and Auth-Token headers)

enable-log-file: false
log-file-path: /var/log/restheart.log
enable-log-console: true

#### Performace Settings

## Read Performance

# default-pagesize is the number of documents returned when the pagesize query
# parameter is not specified
# see https://restheart.org/docs/read-docs/#paging
default-pagesize: 100

# max-pagesize sets the maximum allowed value of the pagesize query parameter
# generally, the greater the pagesize, the more json serializan overhead occurs
# the rule of thumb is not exeeding 1000
max-pagesize: 1000

# cursor-batch-size sets the mongodb cursor batchSize
# see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.batchSize/
# cursor-batch-size should be smaller or equal to the max-pagesize
# the rule of thumb is setting cursor-batch-size equal to max-pagesize
# a small cursor-batch-size (e.g. 101, the default mongodb batchSize)
# speeds up requests with small pagesize
cursor-batch-size: 1000

## Caches

# local-cache allows to cache the db and collection properties to drammatically 
# improve performaces. Without caching, a GET on a document would requires 
# two additional queries to retrieve the db and the collection properties.
# Pay attention to local caching only in case of multi-node deployments (horizontal scalability).
# In this case a change in a db or collection properties would reflect on other 
# nodes at worst after TTL milliseconds (cache entries time to live).
# In most of the cases Dbs and collections properties only change at development time.

local-cache-enabled: true
# TTL in milliseconds; specify a value < 0 to never expire cached entries
local-cache-ttl: 60000

schema-cache-enabled: true
# TTL in milliseconds; specify a value < 0 to never expire cached entries
schema-cache-ttl: 60000

## Limits

# Limit for the maximum number of concurrent requests being served
requests-limit: 1000

# Time limit in milliseconds for processing queries on the server (without network latency). 0 means no time limit
query-time-limit: 0

# Time limit in milliseconds for processing aggregations on the server (without network latency). 0 means no time limit
aggregation-time-limit: 0

## Eager DB Cursor Preallocation Policy

# In big collections, reading a far page involves skipping the db cursor for many documents resulting in a performance bottleneck
# For instance, with default pagesize of 100, a GET with page=50.000 involves 500.000 skips on the db cursor.
# The eager db cursor preallocation engine boosts up performaces (in some use cases, up to 1000%). the following options control its behavior.

eager-cursor-allocation-pool-size: 100

eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-width: 1000
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-delta: 100
eager-cursor-allocation-linear-slice-heights: [4, 2, 1]
eager-cursor-allocation-random-max-cursors: 20
eager-cursor-allocation-random-slice-min-width: 1000

# In order to save bandwitdth RESTHeart can force requests to support the giz encoding (if not, requests will be rejected)
force-gzip-encoding: false

# Number of I/O threads created for non-blocking tasks. at least 2. suggested value: core*2
io-threads: 2

# Number of threads created for blocking tasks (such as ones involving db access). suggested value: core*16
worker-threads: 8

# Use 16k buffers for best performance - as in linux 16k is generally the default amount of data that can be sent in a single write() call
buffer-size: 16384
buffers-per-region: 20
# Should the buffer pool use direct buffers, this instructs the JVM to use native (if possible) I/O operations on the buffers
direct-buffers: true

  # even when it is not strictly required by the specification.
  # Defaults to true
  ALWAYS_SET_KEEP_ALIVE: true

  # If this is true then a Date header will be added to all responses.
  # The HTTP spec says this header should be added to all responses,
  # unless the server does not have an accurate clock.
