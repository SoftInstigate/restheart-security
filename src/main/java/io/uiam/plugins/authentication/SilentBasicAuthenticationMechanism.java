 * and avoiding to send the Authorization header when authentication fails this
 * is required to avoid the basic authentication popup in web applications
 *
 * If silent is true then this mechanism will only take effect if there is an
 * Authorization header.
 *
 * This allows you to combine basic auth with form auth, so human users will use
 * form based auth, but allows programmatic clients to login using basic auth.
